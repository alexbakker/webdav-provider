WebDAV Provider is an app that can expose WebDAV through Android's Storage Access Framework (SAF),
allowing you to access your WebDAV storage through Android's built-in file explorer,
as well as other compatible apps on your device.

<b>This app does not have its own user interface to browse files.</b>
Once you've configured your WebDAV account in the app, use your device's built-in file explorer to browse files.

<b>We do not offer WebDAV cloud storage.</b>
Sign up for an account with a third-party cloud storage provider that supports WebDAV and enter your credentials in the app.
You may use your own NAS or Nextcloud server.

<b>Open source and license:</b>
WebDAV Provider is open source and licensed under GPLv3.
